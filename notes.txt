"Look for a Solution before Building a Solution"

%{ String Contents }
  is one choice when defining a string that spans multiple lines.




//////////////////////////////////////////////////
TYPO FIXES:

  Rubyâ€™s ERB section:
  remove 'an'
  Defining an ERB template is extremely similar
  to our existing template. The difference is
  that we use 'an' escape sequence tags which allow
  us to insert any variables, methods or ruby
  code we want to execute.

  Binding
  'A' to 'An'
  The method binding returns a special object.
  This object is an instance of Binding.
  'A' instance of binding knows all about
  the current state of variables and methods
  within the given scope. In this case, binding
  here knows about the variable meaning_of_life.
